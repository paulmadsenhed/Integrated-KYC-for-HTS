## Abstract

This specification proposes .

## Motivation

Hedera Token Service allows an authorized key(s) to set a flag on Hedera accounts to indicate that Know Your Customer (KYC) checks have been performed on the corresponding user. The expected usage is that tokens that are regulated will require participants check for the presence of the flag before engaging with a particular account. The flag indicates only that KYC has been performed, not the specifics of the identity verification. It is likely that, for some , a binary flag will be insufficient and more details about the KYC check (e.g. who performed it, when, how etc) will be necessary. 

Separately, our DID method and Verifiable Credential (VC) support enables a decentralized identity model in which a user’s wallet can store their identity credentials (such as KYC status) and HCS is used to create a decentralized and auditable registry of supporting metadata (like DID Documents and VC hashes). These features do not presume that a user being issued a VC also has a Hedera account – the only Hedera account necessary is that which created the HCS topic and those paying for the messages. 

Currently, the two use cases, and the Hedera features that enable them, are disconnected. There is, by no default, no connection between the KYC VC a user might have (and the underlying DIDs), and any Hedera account they might own and the token specific KYC flag(s) on that account. 


## Rationale

It would be desirable to provide a more integrated solution between these two related Hedera features.  

For instance, if an account’s owner has been KYC’d, then both the KYC flag should be set to true and a corresponding VC be issued to the user. If the user did not already have an account, then the creation of one could be initiated. 

Similarly, if and when an application was subsequently assessing whether or not a particular account had been KYC’d (in order to determine if a transaction should be allowed), if the flag were true then it should be possible for the application to additionally indicate its desire to have the corresponding VC presented to it (presumably because it wants to know the specifics of the KYC checks). 

Or, if a check of the flag indicated the user had not been KYC’d, then the application could direct the user agent to a relevant KYC provider for the issuance of a KYC VC (and the flag being set to true as above). 
 
Or, even if the KYC flag for one token is not true, the ability of a user to actually present a KYC VC to the application could satisfy the more fundamental regulatory concern.

    * Check for KYC status of a Hedera account for a particular token using HAPI CryptoGetInfo
    * Obtain KYC VC from KYC Wallet
        * Resolve user DID to get public key
        * Check wallet signature corresponds to public key
        * Parse KYC VC to  
            * get KYC VC Issuer DID and resolve against appnet 
            * Verify KYC VC Issuer signature on VC 
            * Check KYC VC revocation status against appnet 
* Appnet nodes
    * Store the HCS timestamped registry of DID Documents (with enclosed public keys) and VC hashes
    * Respond to queries for DID resolution and VC revocation checks 

 
### VC Issuance Flow

1.    The user is engaged with a KYC provider
1.    The user presents identity documents to the KYC provider 
1.    The KYC provider verifies the docs 
1.    The KYC provider
    2.    Issues a VC attesting to the user having passed KYC. The VC is downloaded to the user’s wallet app
    2.    Sets the KYC flag for the user’s account to ‘true’ using a TokenGrantKYC message
